				As Evelyn begins her journey through the multiverse,
				tearing across time and space, an underlying battle she has is 
				undiagnosed ADHD. Evelyn’s mind wanders off to escape from her reality,
				and her scatter-brained tendencies cause frustration from her family.
				She constantly insists that she is “paying attention” yet she completely
				zones out and starts daydreaming in the middle of a conversation with the 
				IRS officer, Dierdre. When discussing the questionable purchase of a
				karaoke machine for the laundromat, her husband, Waymond, apologizes on
				her behalf, saying that “my wife often confuses her hobbies for business."
				The film shows an interesting depiction of ADHD, uniquely exploring its struggles
				in a subtle, yet colorful and chaotic way.

				One of the main relationships in the film is between mother, Evelyn, and rebellious adult
				daughter, Joy. Joy is openly gay and wants to introduce her girlfriend, Becky, to her grandpa, Gong Gong,
				at their family’s Chinese New Year party, but Evelyn is reluctant to acknowledge Joy's queerness. She 
				deliberately misgenders Becky as "he" rather than "she" and tells Joy that she's "very lucky your mom is open to you dating a girl."
				When Becky finally does meet Gong Gong, Evelyn says that she's Joy's "good friend." These actions are a great depiction of how the
				Asian American community deals with the tension that comes from a queer child coming out to their parents. It’s
				almost brushed over or ignored, the parents waiting for the ‘phase’ to end. It represents the struggle of fighting for the chance
				to be seen.

			</div>
			<div class="masc-para">
				Evelyn's sweet husband, Waymond, is the perfect character to subtly counter and subvert emasculating stereotypes of Asian men.
				His kindness, authenticity and silliness are strengths, making him one of the film's heros.
				In the beginning, he comes off as too silly and unserious as he banters with customers and puts googly eyes on inanimate objects
				With the IRS audit meeting looming, Evelyn frantically tries to put paperwork together while Waymond focuses on making cookies
				for the auditor, to Evelyn's dismay. Evelyn’s critical view of her husband mirrors Western stereotypes of Asian men – 
				Waymond’s goofiness and lightheartedness are equated with weakness and incapability. As the story develops, it is clear that
				Waymond is the opposite of weak, using his kindness to fight, which Evelyn learns from herself. He acts as her guide and protector,
				portraying an Asian male character that can be both kind and badass.

			</div>
			<div class="trauma-para">
				This film touches upon the topic of intergenerational trauma. Hurt people hurt people. Ssomeone living with trauma
				will often inflict trauma on the ones closest to them which is exactly what we see with Evelyn. When she decided to
				marry Waymond, Gong Gong disapproved. Evelyn felt abandoned by her parents, leading to a lot of unprocessed guilt and anger. 
				She blamed Waymond and distanced herself from him physically and emotionally, then inflicted the same judgment upon Joy. 
				The plot develops to bring Evelyn to a point where she can recognize her own trauma and the effect its had on her husband and daughter.
				Once she recognized this, she found catharsis and began to move on, make changes in her life, and healing her relationships. 
				Evelyn realizes that no matter where they are, she will always want to be with her family, overcoming their traumas and
				breaking the generational cycle.

			<div class="love-para">
				At the heart of the film is the message that love overcomes all, so long as one is willing to listen and approach things with an open heart.
				Specifically, it leans into the layered dynamic between a parent and their child, as well as husband and wife.
				Evelyn and Joy have so much pain from their familial relationships, but an unimaginable amount of love. Through their trials and trauma,
				they realize that they will always want to be with each other, no matter what. Evelyn and Waymond’s relationship is also a testament to the power of love.
				With Evelyn constantly distracted by work and Waymond ready to get a divorce, it’s clear their relationship is not what it used to be.
				However when it mattered, Waymond continued to show Evelyn that he loves her. No matter how far away she has pushed him in every universe,
				he’s there to support her. Realising that her husband has been there for her all this while reminds Evelyn of what she has to live for.

				“Existentialism” and “nihilism” are often used interchangeably, both agreeing that life is meaningless.
				However, existentialism is hopeful, while nihilism is pessimistic. Existentialism says, “Nothing matters! Might as well push through all the absurdity and make of my existence what I want.”
				Nihilism says, “Fuck you and everything.” Nihilism is best represented by Jobu Tupaki and the "Everything Bagel". She wants to destroy all not for the fun of it but because why not? Why not destroy everything if she can’t find the meaning of it all.
				Existentialism is represented at the very end by Evelyn, the mother who came to accept the absurdity of it all: her rebellious daughter, her goofy husband, her crabby father, her tyrannical IRS agent, her failing laundromat business, and herself — failed again and again.
				Through her mother’s acceptance, Jobu Tupaki finds peace as Joy and Evelyn learns to see that beauty in her existence in the vast multiuniverse.
